# Module 2: Data Insights - QA

# Exercise 1: Getting Started with Azure 
Duration: 10 mins

## Overview 

**Verifying Static Value and key :**

* **checkNNumber:** <inject key="testKey2" value="StaticValue2" key="testkay1"  value="StaticValue1" />

 **checkNNumber:** <inject key="testKey2" value="StaticValue2" />

* **checkNNumber:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword" value="StaticValue3" />

Enable Copy - True -----------------

* **checkNNumber:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail" value="StaticValue2" key="AzureAdUserPassword" value="StaticValue1" 
    enableCopy="true" />

Enable Copy - False -----------------

* **checkNNumber:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword" value="StaticValue4" key="AzureAdUserEmail" enableCopy="false" />

Sample Static Test Data ................

In this exercise, you will log in to the Azure Portal and review the pre-deployed resources as part of the lab environment.

### Getting Started with Lab - Replacement Test Pass 
1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine and lab guide will get loaded into your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab.

2. To get the lab environment details, you can select the **Environment Details** tab. Additionally, the credentials will also be sent to your email address provided during registration.

3. You can also open the Lab Guide on a separate full window by selecting the **Split Window** button on the bottom right corner.

## Task 1: Log in to Azure Portal and verify the pre-deployed resources

1. Let us start by logging into the Azure Portal to check the resources deployed for the lab environment. In the virtual machine (VM) on the left, click on the Azure portal desktop icon as shown below.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex1-azureportal.png?raw=true)

1. On the **Sign in to Microsoft Azure** window, you will see the login screen, enter the following username and click on Next
    * Email/Username1 : <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.   

   * Password : <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
   
       ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex1-portalsignin-2.png?raw=true)

1.  FIRST time Users are often prompted to **Stay Signed In**, if you see any such message, click on **No** 

       ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex1-portalsignin-3.png?raw=true)

1. If you see the pop-up **You have free Azure Advisor recommendations!**, close the window to continue the lab.

1. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure Replacement Test** popup window appears, click **Maybe Later** to skip the tour.

1. Now you can see Azure Portal Dashboard, click on **Resource groups** from the Navigate panel to see the resource groups.

       ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex1-rg.png?raw=true)

1. Click on the **aiw-sap-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** Resource group and confirm whether you have all the below resources deployed successfully.

   In the RESOURCE group we have one **Virtual Machine**, **Logic App**, **Service Bus** and **IoT Hub** deployed.

   **Virtual Machine**: You will be using the Virtual Machine which is already open on the left side of the page to perform all the lab exercises.

   **IoT Hub**: QA Input Using the existing IoT hub you will create an IoT hub device and view the telemetry data that is being sent to IoT Hub.

   **Service Bus** INPUT: You will use the Service bus to store the data generated by the IoT hub device in a Service bus queue.

   **Logic App**: You will be using the logic app to create a workflow that monitors the Service bus queue and sends an e-mail notification whenever a message is added to the **queue**.

## Summary
**
In this exercise, you signed in to the Azure Portal and reviewed the pre-deployed resources.**

 of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised
words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to
use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
 embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators
 on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this
the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200
Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate
Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
 free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.">
